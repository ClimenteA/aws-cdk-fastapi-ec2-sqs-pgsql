# LogsApi

Basic restapi example for spinning up an aws restapi in AWS Cloud Development Kit (infrastructure as code).

## This is the dockerized version of the restapi with postgres, pgadmin and caddyserver

This app just works if dumped in a virtual machine and Caddyfile is configured with the domains.
